        <br>
        Explore<br><br>
        Step one of learning starts with exploration. The neurons in the brain of young children are connecting at a furious pace and need stimulation from the five senses. <img src = "https://goodstart.org.au/getattachment/a0e0f037-3875-4511-a2f2-797fb52b4cd0/myimage.jpg" align = "right" height = 180 width = 200>In this stage learning is based on hands on experiences that lead to thinking and logical skills. Exploring ideas, thoughts, shaping and reshaping projects are all integral aspects of this stage. For a learning based project it is important that children immerse in the idea and concept to explore it from all angles. Our model helps support this exploration in children.

        Experience<br><br>
        Stage two of learning is shaped with experience. Having already explored with the senses, in this stage children connect that exploration with past knowledge and create their<img src = "https://images.ctfassets.net/q5lwz1whkyct/5RmvoqIqsWo3c1PFQLicOf/9fd4399a8df303b02e771420f5b9fd70/books-1200x880.png" align = "left" width = 200 height = 150> thoughts and shape their ideas that leads to knowledge and understanding of the world around them. Analyzing, optimizing, restructuring are some of the high end pre-frontal skills developed at this stage. John Dewey’s model of “Project Based Learning” along with Jean Piaget’s “Cognitive Learning Theory” are incorporated at this stage to help children experience knowledge with understanding.

        Implement<br><br>
        Stage three of learning, ‘implementation’, is the goal of all education. Knowledge is not complete unless it is applied and used to bring about change both in the individual and the society. <img src = "https://www3.swipeclock.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/swipeclock-implement-new-system.jpg" align = "right" height = 200 width = 200>At this stage students are encouraged to implement their ideas and bring about a change in their practice and their thinking. Implementation also helps the students understand ‘what works’ and ‘what does not work’ so that they can work on restructuring and redesigning the idea to suit the needs of the project. At the implementation stage students are encouraged to be independent and experience opportunities of success that help define their self-worth and self-esteem.

        Curriculum and Content Development is at the core of the Citizen Innovation Centre. The team specializes in creating curriculum and content based on the guidelines of various boards including CBSE, ICSE, CAIE and the Maharashtra State Board.
        The Curriculum and Content Team of the PIC provides a wide <img src = "https://miro.medium.com/max/822/1*kJoopUyP-6d58kI0JiiOQA.jpeg" align = "left" width = 270 height = 200>range of academic solutions to schools, within and outside the Citizen Education Network, including those aligned to the Citizen Curriculum Consultancy and the Citizen Learn Schools.
        The Citizen System of Education values the child as a strong, capable and resilient individual, rich with wonder and knowledge. Every child brings with him deep curiosity and potential and this innate curiosity drives his interest to understand the world and his place within it. Our curriculum allows the child to reflect, solve, create, grow and most importantly, think.

        Teachers Resources
        <br>
        <br>
        Teachers need to make wise decisions about the strategies and methods that they would apply to help learners understand & move systematically toward learner centric goals. Lesson planning is a vital component of the teaching-learning process. <img src = "https://i1.wp.com/www.additudemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111_5_School_9-adhd-strategies-for-teachers_SS_111_math-students-hands-raised_ts-486325400.jpg" align = "right" width = 290 height = 150>Proper classroom planning keeps teachers organized and on track while teaching. The better prepared the teacher is, the more likely she will be able to handle whatever unexpectedly happens in the lesson. PIC provides user friendly Teacher’s Manuals to guide teachers on how to facilitate successful lessons. The Teacher's manual is the instructor’s road map of what students need to learn and how to deliver the lesson effectively during the given class time. The manuals recommend the use of stories, poems and other stimuli as set induction. They incorporate instructional strategies that lead to fruitful thinking. They provide the teacher with tips to integrate learnings together and make the lessons interactive.

        <center>The right faculty</center>
        <br><br><br>
        At Citizen, we take our teaching seriously and believe that the most important aspect of a school is the quality of their faculty. We have seen over the past 90 years that when a child is comfortable and having fun while learning, the child is able to grasp the subject much more efficiently. We make sure it is the right person for the right job at all times. Hence we employ a two-pronged approach to get best teachers for our students.
        <br><br>
        Recruitment
        <br><br>
        At Citizen International Schools, a lot of attention is paid to each candidate before he or she is selected as a teacher. Among the qualities tested for are the attitudes, <img src = "https://continental-search.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/social_media_recruitment.png" align = "right" width = 290 height = 200>approach to teaching, ability to deal with children, their thought process and their understanding of child psychology.

        Furthermore, a thorough background check both via standard verification checks as well as our own, maintains the standard we prescribe for our teachers.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, we have an on-going teacher development programme that makes sure our teachers are up-to-date with the trends, technologies, methodologies, best practices and breakthroughs in the field of education.

        <center>The right environment</center>
        <br><br><br>
        At Citizen International Schools, we develop our school infrastructure with an aim to maximise the potential of each student to learn, reduce distractions, enhance focus and remove any form of discomfort or difficulty.

        Hence our schools are designed incorporating the principles of ergonomics at all levels. Our classrooms are spacious making sure the students can focus on the lesson. We have specially designed furniture in each of our school classrooms that make sure the student is comfortable all throughout the school session.
        <br><br>
        Classroom technology
        <br><br>
        At Citizen International Schools, our teaching methodology expands beyond the boundaries of traditional board and chalk teaching to include technology and <img src = "https://sites.globalhealth.duke.edu/dukekcmcmepi/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/08/computer-lab-computers.jpg" align = "left" height = 150 width = 250> modern techniques wherever possible. To help students understand and visually relate to complex concepts, every classroom has been provided with projectors & visualisers. With the help of such technology we make sure our students have a firm grasp on the subject matter and are able to think in three-dimensional space.

        The library
        <br><br>
        At Citizen International Schools, the library is not a sanctum of silence but a world of adventure. With an expansive collection of books on every facet of every subject, <img src = "https://jgu.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/global-library-main_0_0-1.jpg" align = "left" height = 150 width = 250>Citizen International Schools take a no-expense-spared approach to stocking the library. Since we train our students to ask questions, we also inculcate in them the curiosity for research and give them the perfect playground for finding out more about everything.
