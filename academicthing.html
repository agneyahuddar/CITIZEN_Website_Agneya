            Our curriculum is child-centred and personalised. In Early Years, learning takes place principally through guided play. As work gradually becomes more structured in Primary School, lessons are planned with a view to making them interesting <img src = "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/collegiatetimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/e9/ee9d192c-fbdf-11e7-b19c-cff6c1f6a73f/5a5fdf4c80c13.image.jpg" align = "right" height = 200 width = 250>and engaging. As they move into Secondary School, children receive teaching by subject specialists. Teachers plan lessons with differentiated outcomes, allowing for a range of achievements.
